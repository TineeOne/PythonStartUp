# NameError: name 'car_pool_capacity' is not defined

# The NameError above is due to the fact that the author typed 
# `car_pool_capacity` but the actual variable is `carpool_capacity`, no
# underscore character between 'car' and 'pool'.
# NameError means the 'name' of the variable is unknown or has not yet 
# been defined.

# Why do we use 4.0 instead of 4?
# What happens if it's just 4?

# 4.0 is a floating point number, while 4 is an integer.
# floating point numbers can represent fractions, while integers cannot.
# If the integer `4` was used vs. `4.0`, the `carpool_capacity` would be
# integer `120` vs. floating point `120.0`. The floating point is not 
# necessary here in this case, but it doesn't hurt and is good practice to
# consider.
