## Python Regaining

The Book: "Learn Python the Hard Way", the third edition, by Zed A. Shaw, who teaches beginners in programming learn to write code. 

The Challenge: 3 months. 52 exercises (including study drills). and A final project. Second time to do it.

Reopen the folder PythonStartUp, I try to rewrite exercises by using Python 3 with help of the fourth version of Learn Python the Hard Way. Typying every word in transcript correctly is easy, while figuring out the reason why they are constructed takes some time. One way the book recommends is writing a comment above each line explaining it. It means you need to ask yourself again and again why it should be like that and write down your answer. Writing or making output will push you to understand what items exactly mean and what the logical relationships between them. 

Take the study drill 2 of Excecise 6: Strings and Text as an example.
